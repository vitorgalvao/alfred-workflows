WatchList saves your media and streams to a list, eases the choice of what to play next and gets rid of it when you‚Äôre done.

For local content, select the files and directories to add and apply the `Add to watchlist` file action. If the `move_on_add` Workflow Environment Variable is set, the paths will be moved to that directory. Items will be prepended or appended to the list depending on the `add_item_order` Workflow Environment Variable. Calling `swl` adds the URL in your clipboard as a stream (‚åò‚Üµ for the full playlist).

Use the `lists_dir` Workflow Environment Variable to pick a custom save location for your data. This allows for easy syncing and cloud backups.

Next, interact with your list. Options begin with `wl`.

`wlp` shows the list of items to play. A reference to each subtitle section can be found at the end.

`wls` calls `wlp` under the hood, but with a custom sort order.

In both cases:

* ‚Üµ plays the selection.
* ‚åÉ‚Üµ plays without marking as watched.
* ‚å•‚Üµ downloads a stream (requires [DownMedia](https://github.com/vitorgalvao/alfred-workflows/tree/master/DownMedia)) or rescans a series‚Äô directory (useful after manual changes).
* ‚åò‚Üµ marks as watched without playing.
* ‚áß‚Üµ appends to a temporary playlist. After adding the desired items, ‚Üµ plays them in order. A playlist which was neither modified nor played for a few minutes will be ignored.
* ‚áß or ‚åòY shows a Quick Look preview on files and streams.

If the `top_on_play` Workflow Environment Variable is `true`, the item will be moved to the top of the list before beginning playback.

[mpv](http://mpv.io/), [IINA](https://lhc70000.github.io/iina/), and [VLC](http://www.videolan.org/vlc/index.html) are directly supported. If playback exits with a non-zero code, the item will not be marked as played (hence not trashed). Take advantage of that!

`wlu` is the watched list. Its size is controlled by the `maximum_watched` Workflow Environment Variable. Actioning an item will mark it unwatched but won‚Äôt recover it from the trash (there is no reliable way to do it on macOS). If the item has an origin URL (shown in the subtitle):

* ‚åò‚Üµ opens it in the default web browser.
* ‚å•‚Üµ copies it to the clipboard.
* ‚áß or ‚åòY shows a Quick Look preview.

`wle` is for reordering, renaming, and manually removing of items.

If you use [DownMedia](https://github.com/vitorgalvao/alfred-workflows/tree/master/DownMedia) it has an option to add the downloaded video files directly to your watchlist.

#### Subtitle reference:

There are three types of items: `files`, `series`, and `streams`. `stream`s can be further categorised into single item or playlist. Each result has its name as the top title. The subtitle confers more detailed information and follows this template:

```
‚âà (4) êÑÅ 22m 32s êÑÅ 691M êÑÅ /Some/Path
```

* ‚âà. Indicates item is a `stream`.
    * `file`: N/A.
    * `series`: N/A.
    * `stream`: Always present.
* (4). Number of elements.
    * `file`: N/A.
    * `series`: Remaining audiovisual files in directory.
    * `stream`: Single item: N/A. Playlist: All elements.
* 22m 32s. Running time.
    * `file`: Running time of file.
    * `series`: Running time of first audiovisual file in directory.
    * `stream`: Combined running time of all elements.
* 691M. Size.
    * `file`: Size of file.
    * `series`: Size of first audiovisual file in directory.
    * `stream`: N/A.
* /Some/Path. Path.
    * `file`: Path of file.
    * `series`: Path of directory.
    * `stream`: URL.
