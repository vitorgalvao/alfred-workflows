Call `nf` followed by a file name (if you don’t give it an extension, it’ll be `.txt`) to make a new file. If you type `nfo` instead the files will open after creation. If you have a Finder or Path Finder window as your frontmost window, the file will be created there, otherwise it will be created on your Desktop.
