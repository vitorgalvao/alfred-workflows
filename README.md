# Alfred Workflows

> [!IMPORTANT]
> I used to publish all my [Alfred](https://alfredapp.com/) Workflows to this page but have since changed that practice to publishing them to individual homes. This repository is deprecated and continues to exist solely for historical purposes and so people know where to look to update their bookmarks, watches, forks, stars, and other records.

My Workflows are published to the [Alfred Gallery](https://alfred.app/). As a [member of the Alfred team](https://www.alfredapp.com/blog/announcements/alfred-team-is-growing/) I release new Workflows either to the [official Alfred Team page](https://alfred.app/workflows/alfredapp/) or a [personal creator page](https://alfred.app/workflows/vitor/) depending on the Workflow. You can find the individual repositories for each Workflow from the links on the top right of their Gallery pages.

## Historical Workflows and Tools

These following are helpers and Workflows which have been deprecated and are not kept anywhere else. Some were proofs of concept, a few used APIs or services which no longer exist, but most were made obsolete by Alfred features such as [Automation Tasks](https://www.alfredapp.com/help/workflows/automations/automation-task/) which provide convenient ways to replicate the same functionality to your liking with no coding required.

As they were not transferred to new repositories, the following tables points to commits were their latest versions were available.
