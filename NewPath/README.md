Run the New File Keyword (default: `nf`) followed by a name to make a new empty file in the frontmost Finder location. Running the New File and Open Keyword (default: `nfo`) does the same and opens it after creation.

There are equivalent keywords for New Folder (default: `nd`) and New Folder and Open (default: `ndo`). Adding `/` in the name allows for the quick creation of nested folders.
